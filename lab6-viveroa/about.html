        <h2>Investment Strategy</h2>
        <p>GECC seeks to generate current income and capital appreciation by investing in middle-market companies that operate in a range of industries. We expect to make multi-year investments, primarily in senior secured debt instruments that we purchase in the secondary market, although we may also originate investments directly. We seek to protect against risk of impairment by investing in borrowers with tangible and intangible assets, where we believe asset values are expected to exceed the market value of the cumulative debt. We focus on investments whose total return potential is appropriately balanced against potential investment risks.</p>
