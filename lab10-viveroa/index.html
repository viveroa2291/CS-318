                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>The Gallopin Goose was established in 1873 by my great-grandmother, Marike. She <br>
                        inherited from her father a 23 acre apple orchard and his prized goose Gertrude at the <br>
                        age of 16. IN the beginning she would sell cider and pies on the edge of town to the <br>
                        villagers. Eventually she saved enough turn the farmhouse at the end of her land into <br>
                        The Galloping Goose. Over the last century The Galloping Goose has been handed <br>
                        down to the eldest daughter who keeps the legacy of the pub alive.
