            <h3>Völuspá</h3>
            <h4>Stanzas 1-5</h4>
            <p>Hearing I ask | from the holy races, <br>
                From Heimdall's sons, | both high and low; <br>
                Thou wilt, Valfather, | that well I relate <br>
                Old tales I remember | of men long ago.</p>
            <p>I remember yet | the giants of yore, <br>
                Who gave me bread | in the days gone by; <br>
                Nine worlds I knew, | the nine in the tree <br>
                With mighty roots | beneath the mold.</p>
            <p>Of old was the age | when Ymir lived; <br>
                Sea nor cool waves | nor sand there were; <br>
                Earth had not been, | nor heaven above, <br>
                But a yawning gap, | and grass nowhere.</p>
            <p>Then Bur's sons lifted | the level land, <br>
                Mithgarth the mighty | there they made; <br>
                The sun from the south | warmed the stones of earth, <br>
                And green was the ground | with growing leeks.</p>
            <p>The sun, the sister | of the moon, from the south <br>
                Her right hand cast | over heaven's rim; <br>
                No knowledge she had | where her home should be, <br>
                The moon knew not | what might was his, <br>
                The stars knew not | where their stations were. <br>

        <section id="Yggdrasil">
            <h3>Yggdrasil</h3>
            <p>Yggdrasil is a tree central to the Norse concept of the cosmos. The tree's branches extend into various realms, and various creatures dwell on and around it. The gods go to Yggdrasil daily to assemble at their things, traditional governing assemblies. The branches of Yggdrasil extend far into the heavens, and the tree is supported by three roots that extend far away into other locations; one to the well Urðarbrunnr in the heavens, one to the spring Hvergelmir, and another to the well Mímisbrunnr. Creatures live within Yggdrasil, including the dragon Níðhöggr, an unnamed eagle, and the stags Dáinn, Dvalinn, Duneyrr and Duraþrór.</p>

        <section id="Asgard">
            <h3>Asgard</h3>
            <p>In Norse mythology, Asgard (/ˈɑːsɡɑːrd, ˈæs-/; Old Norse: Ásgarðr; "Enclosure of the Æsir") is one of the Nine Realms and home to the Æsir, tribe of gods. It is surrounded by an incomplete wall attributed to a Hrimthurs riding the stallion Svaðilfari, according to Gylfaginning. Odin and his wife, Frigg, are the rulers of Asgard.</p>

        <section id="Vanaheimr">
            <h3>Vanaheimr</h3>
            <p>Vanaheimr (Vanaheim) is the dwelling of the Vanir gods. Vanaheimr is linked to the other Realms of the World Tree. It's residents, the Vanir gods, were once at war with the other clan of gods, the Æsir.</p>

        <section id="Alfheim">
            <h3>Alfheim</h3>
            <p>Alfheimr (Old Norse: Ālfheimr, "elf home") is one of the Nine Realms and the Light Elves' (Álfar or just Elves)homeworld in Norse mythology. It was ruled over by Freyr . It appears also in Anglo-Scottish ballads under the name Elfhame (Elphame, Elfame) as a fairyland, sometimes modernized as Elfland (Elfinland, Elvenland).</p>
        </section>
        <section id="Midgard">
            <h3>Midgard</h3>
            <p>Midgard (Old Norse: Miðgarðr meaning "middle enclosure") is one of the Nine Realms of Norse mythology. It is the realm of humans (mortals) and is the only realm fully visible to mankind, though other realms intersect with it. Midgard is bordered by Niflheim to the north and Muspelheim to the south. It is surrounded by an ocean inhabited by the world-encircling Jörmungandr, often referred to as "Miðgarðsormr" or the "Midgard serpent". It is also connected to Asgard, the realm of the Æsir, by the Bifröst.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="Jötunheimr">
            <h3>Jötunheimr</h3>
            <p>From Jötunheimr, the giants menace the humans in Midgard and the gods in Asgard. The river Ifing (Old Norse, Ífingr) separates Asgard, the realm of the gods, from Jötunheimr, the land of giants. Gastropnir, the protection wall to the home of Menglad, and Þrymheimr, home of Þjazi, were both located in Jötunheimr, which was ruled by King Thrym. Glæsisvellir was a location in Jötunheimr, where lived the giant Gudmund, father of Höfund. Utgard was a stronghold surrounding the land of the giants.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="Muspelheim">
            <h3>Muspelheim</h3>
            <p>Muspelheim (Old Norse: Múspellsheimr), also called Muspell (Old Norse: Múspell), is one of the Nine Realms and is the realm of fire in Norse mythology. It is the homeworld of the fire jötunn (giants) or the "sons of Muspell", and Surtr (Surtur), their ruler. Muspelheim is fire; and the land to the North, Niflheim, is ice. The two mixed and created water from the melting ice in Ginnungagap, from which Ymir was born.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="Svartálfar">
            <h3>Svartálfar</h3>
            <p>In Norse mythology, Svartálfar (Old Norse "black elves", sing. svartálfr), also called myrkálfar ("dark elves", "dusky elves", "murky elves", sing. myrkálfr), are beings who dwell in Svartalfheim (Svartálf[a]heimr, "home of the black-elves"). Both the svartálfar and Svartálfaheimr are primarily attested in the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. Scholars have noted that the svartálfar appear to be synonymous with the dwarves and potentially also the dökkálfar ("dark elves"). As dwarfs, the home of the svartálfar could possibly be another description for Nidavellir (Niðavellir, "dark fields").</p>

            <h3>Niflheim</h3>

Only the dead who die in sleep of cowardly (not in battle) end up here. It is the home of the Niddhog, a dragon who eats at the roots of the tree that bind it.</p>
